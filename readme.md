Once complete, this repository will contain all resources necessary to build and 
program a basic arduino robot that steers based on audio frequency, plus a small
theremin-like controller. 

The purpose of this project is to introduce future engineers to a variety of electrical,
mechanical, and computer engineering concepts.
